This is an important\\ntrend, and I urge everyone who works in AI to pay attention to it.\\n\\nToday, we mostly use LLMs in zero-shot mode, prompting a model to generate\\nfinal output token by token without revising its work. This is akin to asking\\nsomeone to compose an essay from start to finish, typing straight through with\\nno backspacing allowed, and expecting a high-quality result. Despite the\\ndifficulty, LLMs do amazingly well at this task!\\n\\nWith an agent workflow, however, we can ask the LLM to iterate over a document\\nmany times. For example, it might take a sequence of steps such as:\\n\\n  * Plan an outline.\\n  * Decide what, if any, web searches are needed to gather more information.\\n  * Write a first draft.\\n  * Read over the first draft to spot unjustified arguments or extraneous information.\\n  * Revise the draft taking into account any weaknesses spotted.\\n  * And so on.\\n\\nThis iterative process is critical for most human writers to write good text.\\nWith AI, such an iterative workflow yields much better results than writing in\\na single pass.\\n\\n[Devin](https://www.cognition-labs.com/introducing-\\ndevin?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz\\n--QGCoaEh42QGUTnfoPl5an-ds0dVuJeNXLRxVO4h72DKVH187SV0hJ06VkEN-DlSHanUDK)’s\\nsplashy demo recently received a lot of social media buzz. My team has been\\nclosely following the evolution of AI that writes code. We analyzed results\\nfrom a number of research teams, focusing on an algorithm’s ability to do well\\non the widely used HumanEval coding benchmark.

      "\n",
      "  * It works! Many teams are getting good results with this method, and there’s nothing like results! Further, ablation studies (for example, in the AutoGen paper cited below) show that multiple agents give superior performance to a single agent. \n",
      "  * Even though some LLMs today can accept very long input contexts (for instance, Gemini 1.5 Pro accepts 1 million tokens), their ability to truly understand long, complex inputs is mixed. An agentic workflow in which the LLM is prompted to focus on one thing at a time can give better performance. By telling it when it should play software engineer, we can also specify what is important in that role’s subtask. For example, the prompt above emphasized clear, efficient code as opposed to, say, scalable and highly secure code. By decomposing the overall task into subtasks, we can optimize the subtasks better.\n",
      "  * Perhaps most important, the multi-agent design pattern gives us, as developers, a framework for breaking down complex tasks into subtasks. When writing code to run on a single CPU, we often break our program up into different processes or threads. This is a useful abstraction that lets us decompose a task, like implementing a web browser, into subtasks that are easier to code. I find thinking through multi-agent roles to be a useful abstraction as well.\n",

      "In many companies, managers routinely decide what roles to hire, and then how\n",
      "to split complex projects — like writing a large piece of software or\n",
      "preparing a research report — into smaller tasks to assign to employees with\n",

Reflection involves agents assessing their own performance and adjusting accordingly. Tool Use allows agents to utilize external tools to enhance their capabilities. Planning focuses on agents organizing tasks and workflows effectively. Multi-Agent Collaboration breaks down complex tasks into subtasks handled by different agents, optimizing performance through specialization.\n"
